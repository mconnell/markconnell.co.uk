title: "Rails 3: Routing Examples"
---

Rails 3 introduced a new routing DSL that is a little bit different from the Rails 2 version. This quick guide covers a few examples of the new routes, and how they compare to Rails 2.

### Simple routes

Create a basic route that will respond to `http://localhost:300/hello_world`

    # Rails 2:
    map.connect 'hello_world', :controller => 'posts', :action => 'index'
    
    # Rails 3:
    match 'hello_world' => 'posts#index'

### Resources

A `UsersController` that responds to the typical RESTful actions `/users`, `/users/123`, `/users/123/edit` etc.

    # Rails 2:
    map.resources :users
    
    # Rails 3:
    resources :users

Add additional `member` and `collection` actions to a resource. For a `GamesController`, adding a download action on a particular game (member) and a favourites action to display a list of favourite games (collection):

    # Rails 2
    map.resources :games, :member => { :download => :get }, :collection => { :favourites => :get }
    
    # Rails 3
    resources :games do
      get :download,   :on => :member
      get :favourites, :on => :collection
    end

`member`/`collection` blocks are also available as an alternative to the above:

    # Rails 3
    resources :games do
      member do
        get :download
      end

      collection do
        get :favourites
      end
    end

### Root mappings
The `root_url` your app points to eg. `http://localhost:3000/`

    # Rails 2
    map.root :controller => 'posts', :action => 'index'

    # Rails 3
    root :to => 'posts#index'

Namespaced root mappings eg. `http://localhost:3000/admin`
    # Rails 2
    map.namespace :admin do |admin|
      admin.root :controller => 'posts'
    end
    
    # Rails 3
    namespace :admin do
      root :to => "admin/posts#index"
    end

One thing to note is that if you are defining a root mapping in a namespace, it doesn't make any assumptions that the controller is in the same namespace in Rails 3.

### Optional params
Allows a mapping to be associated with multiple routes eg: `/posts/2010` and `/posts/2010/02`

    # Rails 2
    map.connect 'posts/:year/:month', :controller => 'posts', :month => nil, :requirements => { :year => /\d{4}/ }

    # Rails 3
    match 'posts/:year(/:month)' => 'posts#index', :constraints => { :year => /\d{4}/ }

You'll notice that this mapping also makes use of the :constraints option rather than :requirements which would be found in a Rails 2 app.
